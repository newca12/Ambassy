## About
Embrace the Unix philosophy, write program that do one thing and do it well.
And if your programs need something else to be done they should contact their local ambassy.

Ambassy is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

## How to use it
This is an ongoing work. Ambassy is not yet usable.
